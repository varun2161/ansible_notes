What is Ansible Tower?
Ansible Tower is the enterprise version of Ansible, providing a web-based UI, REST API, and role-based access control for managing Ansible automation at scale. Itâ€™s developed by Red Hat.

Think of it as a centralized hub where you can manage:

Automation workflows

Job scheduling

Inventory management

Credential storage

Logging and auditing

without needing to run everything manually from the command line.

ðŸ“¦ Key Features:
Web UI & Dashboard: Visual interface for monitoring, running, and scheduling playbooks.

Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Control who can run what, and where.

Job Scheduling: Schedule playbooks to run at specific times or intervals.

API-Driven: Everything Tower does through the UI can be done via its REST API.

Centralized Logging: View logs and output of all automation tasks in one place.

Workflow Automation: Chain multiple playbooks/jobs together in complex workflows.

Inventory Management: Maintain dynamic or static lists of your infrastructure.
